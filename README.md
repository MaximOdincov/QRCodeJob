# QR Code Job (Learning Project)

**What it is:**  
A small Android project made for learning how to work with QR codes. It’s purely for practice and experimenting with generating and scanning QR codes—nothing fancy, nothing production-ready.

**What it can do:**  
- A login screen with role selection (Student / Teacher).  
- Generate a QR code for a student.  
- Scan a QR code as a teacher.  
- Use `ViewModel` and `LiveData` to pass data between fragments.  
- QR code scanning powered by [ZXing / JourneyApps](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded).  

**Tech used:**  
- Kotlin  
- Android Studio  
- ViewBinding  
- LiveData & ViewModel  
- ZXing / Barcode Scanner  

**Status:**  
Just a learning project. Made to understand how QR codes work in Android apps. Not for real-world use.  

**Note:**  
Everything here is for practice. The project is all about learning the basics of QR codes and Android architecture.
